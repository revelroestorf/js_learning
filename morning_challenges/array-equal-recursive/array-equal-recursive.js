/*

  This is the same as yesterday's challenge with one difference.

  arrayEqual should now work with nested arrays.
  e.g. [1,[2,3],4] <- Notice the second element is an array itself?

  Research: recursion :) This is a tough one, whiteboard first!

  Examples (same as yesterday):
  arrayEqual([1,2,3], [1,2,3]) -> true
  arrayEqual([1,2,3], [2,3,4]) -> false
  arrayEqual([1,2,3,[4,5,6]], [1,2,3,[4,5,6]]) -> true

  Don't use JSON.stringify in your solution.

  Check your solution:  Open index.html to run the tests!

function arrayEqual(a, b) {
  // Your code here. Don't use stringify ;)
}
